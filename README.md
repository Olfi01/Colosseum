# Colosseum API - A simple API for Spigot/Paper/Folia plugins

This small API is designed to make it easier to create plugins for Spigot, Paper and Folia.
It adds a few features such as:
- Command handling
- Event handling
- Config handling
- Language handling
- Logging handling
- Update checker
- Singleton GSON instance
- Universal Scheduler for Spigot/Paper/Folia
- Minecraft version utilities

In the future I also plan to add a INVUI like gui system

Unfortunately, I am too lazy to write a proper documentation, so you will have to figure out how to use it by yourself. You can check github pages for the javadocs, or you can check any of my plugins that use this API.
